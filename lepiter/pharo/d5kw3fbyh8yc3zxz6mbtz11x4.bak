What to do? It depends...\r## No Conflicts\rThis would mean none of the same classes modified for Tonel, or none of the same methods modified for FileTree. This CLI script seems to be the simplest fix (replace `master` with the branch in question):\r\r```language=shell\rgit fetch origin master\rgit rebase origin/master\rgit push origin master\r```\rBut, if you're more comfortable in Iceberg, you can:\r1. Drop to the command line and: `git rebase origin/master` (assuming the remote is named `origin`)\r2. Get Iceberg to realize it's out of sync with the local file repo. One way is to bring up the context menu on the project and then \"Extra\" -> \"Recalculate dirty packages\".\r3. Repair repository - choose to discard image changes (don't worry we're not really going to do that). When the preview dialog comes up, select \"DO NOT CHECKOUT...\" from the dropdown. This will make sure that nothing in the image is changed except Iceberg and the local file repo will be in sync again.\r## Conflicts\rHere you'll follow the Iceberg instructions for \"No Conflicts\", but with the following modifications:\r1. Choose, \"Checkout packages already loaded\"\r2. At the end, go into Epicea and revert the in image code changes that wipes out your changes\r\rAlternatively, you could follow the git script for **No Conflicts** and then manually resolve the conflict on the command line."
