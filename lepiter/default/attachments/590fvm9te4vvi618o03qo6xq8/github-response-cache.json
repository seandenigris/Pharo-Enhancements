Or am I misunderstanding how this is supposed to work?\r\n...\r\nTo add your own class-specific messages,  subclass `SpecOfShouldExpression` and redefine `MyDomainObject>>#should` to use your subclass. The one caveat is that it seems if you send `SpecOfShouldExpression class>>#startingAt:`, the global pragma/object setting described in `SpecOfShouldExpression`'s class comment will prevent your subclass from being used. To work around this, just skip that message and define your message thusly:\r\n```smalltalk\r\nMyDomainObject>>#should\r\n\t^ MyCustomShouldSpec new\r\n\t\treceiver: self;\r\n\t\tyourself\r\n```","locked":false,"state":"open","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dionisiydk/StateSpecs/issues/31","milestone":null,"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dionisiydk/StateSpecs","author_association":"NONE","id":898915929,"active_lock_reason":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/dionisiydk/StateSpecs/issues/31","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dionisiydk/StateSpecs/issues/31/events","comments":0}
